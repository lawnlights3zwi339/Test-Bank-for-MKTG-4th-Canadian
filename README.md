* MKTG 4CE provides Introduction to Marketing students with an interactive and engaging learning experience. The growth of this text over the last 10 years has been shaped by not only reviews from instructors teaching the course, but also focus groups with over 300 students from 31 institutions across Canada. This collective feedback has informed the development of this new edition, ensuring we are connected to what instructors and students need in today’s rapidly changing world. The engaging layout, where we consider the pedagogical value of photos, graphics, and white space, is one of the hallmarks that students consistently comment they like the most. A true hybrid solution, MindTap is automatically included with every new purchase. MindTap has been completely redesigned for this new edition. We not only combine all the student learning tools – readings, assessments, flashcards – but we have included interviews with Canadian professionals, a greater variety of videos, and in-line activities within the ebook that allow students to learn and apply as they move through the content. With MKTG 4CE, students not only learn the fundamentals of Marketing, they also develop their soft skills, better preparing them for their career!
